    /// - Parameter alignment: The horizontal alignment to use (e.g. `.leading`, `.center`, or `.trailing`).
    /// - Returns: A view that is stretched horizontally with the specified alignment.

    /// ```swift
    /// Text("Hello, SwiftUI!")
    ///     .hAlign(.center)

    /// Conditionally applies a transformation to the view based on the provided Boolean condition.
    ///
    /// Use this extension to avoid writing explicit ifâ€“else blocks in your view body.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - condition: A Boolean value determining whether to apply the transformation.
    ///   - transform: A closure that takes the view as input and returns a modified view.
    /// - Returns: Either the transformed view (if `condition` is true) or the original view.
    ///
    /// ### Usage:
    /// ```swift
    /// Text("Strike Through Example")
    ///     .if(true) { view in
    ///         view.strikethrough()
    ///     }
    /// ```
